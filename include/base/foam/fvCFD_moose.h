// This file is a workaround for a name clash between OpenFOAM and libMesh,
// which both define the symbol 'NotImplemented'. If you see some cryptic
// build errors in libMesh, then this is likely the problem.
// The solution here is to include what we need from OpenFOAM and then undef
// NotImplemented, which will be redefined by libMesh later. Source files can
// include this file instead of directly including OpenFOAM headers.
// Not a huge amount of science went into what's included here and what's
// included in source files. It was pretty much a case of 'move things until it
// works'.
