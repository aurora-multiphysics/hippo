  [foam_timestepper_sets_foam_t_and_dt]
    # This test checks that the OpenFOAM timesteps are set via the Executuioner
    # in the MOOSE input file.
    # Note that the OpenFOAM controlDict has a dt of 1 and an end time of 20.
    # The MOOSE input file has a dt of 0.5, start time of 1, and end time of
    # 2.5.
